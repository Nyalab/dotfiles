# DuoTone snow

A double-hue white syntax theme for Atom based on [duotone-syntax](https://github.com/simurai/duotone-syntax).

I prefer dark themes but working for full days in dark IDE take their toll on the eyes ([proof](http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/53264/dark-or-white-color-theme-is-better-for-the-eyes)). So I decided to contribute a white syntax theme.

DuoTone themes use only 2 hues (7 shades in total). It __tones down__ less important parts (like punctuation and brackets) and highlights only the __important__ ones. This leads to a more calm color scheme, but still lets you find the stuff you're looking for.

## Language support

DuoTone themes are optimized for many languages:

> C, Clojure, CoffeeScript, C#, CSS, GF Markdown, Go, Haskell, HTML, Java, JavaScript, JSON, Less, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, SASS, SCSS, Stylus, XML, YAML...

More optimizations to come. See the growing list of [all languages](/styles/languages).
