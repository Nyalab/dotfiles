# Key Peek

### What is this?

This is your beloved [Keybinding Resolver](https://atom.io/packages/keybinding-resolver) for the Atom editor, except:
* It is slimmed down (only shows one line: the matched key binding)
* The different sections are formatted a little prettier.

#### Toggle

Command Palette (`Ctrl-Shift-P`):

By default, this package doesn't get triggered by a key binding, it's up to you to choose one if you wish.

For example, you could override the built-in Keybinding Resolver to use **Key Peek** instead, simply by adding one or all of these to your keymap:

```cson
'.platform-darwin':
  'cmd-.': 'key-binding-resolver:toggle'

'.platform-win32':
  'ctrl-.': 'key-binding-resolver:toggle'

'.platform-linux':
  'ctrl-.': 'key-binding-resolver:toggle'
```

This was meant as an exercise for myself, but I thought others might find it useful, too.
[Let me know](https://github.com/batjko/key-peek/issues) if you have any problems with it or want to suggest changes.
