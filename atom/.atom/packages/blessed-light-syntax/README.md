# Blessed Light Syntax

A syntax theme based on @simurai's [Duotone Light Syntax](https://github.com/simurai/duotone-light-syntax).

Blessed Light uses only 2 hues and 7 shades in total. It __tones down__ less important parts (like punctuation and brackets) and highlights only the __important__ ones. This leads to a more calm color scheme, but still lets you find the stuff you're looking for.
