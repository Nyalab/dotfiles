There's no point having a bunch of variables and functions spelt 'colour'\nwhen all the libraries we use spell it 'color', confusion would rein.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/bkbooth/color-gutter/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/bkbooth/color-gutter","_id":"color-gutter@0.3.1","_shasum":"5189cbf818382a1c9ea852ac4171849ac7403bfa","_resolved":"file:../d-115113-10371-pcuzws/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115113-10371-pcuzws/package.tgz"}
